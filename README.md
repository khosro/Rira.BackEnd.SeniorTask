## Using  `Protocol Buffers` to implement

[gRPC model](@Common/Protos/person.proto)

[gRPC implementation](Server/Servers/gRPC)

### I have not used `Protocol Buffers` before, so that i use the following resources :

## What solutions do you suggest if the operation failed?

In Client-Server model, errors are as follows

1. Client Side error :

	1.1. Client error such as JavaScript error that we sholud use `local storage` or `IndexedDB` or ... to log them (i have not used them) and then send them to server for furtur investigation.
         I think we should log the following info :
     
      1. Page URL that user encounter error
      2. Full JavaScript stack trace error
      3. Any operation user did, such as clicking button, selection a checkbox and ...
      4. User that did the operation
   
   1.2. Error calling server side operation.
   
      1. Logic validation error such as `Name is required`. They should be show to user.
      
         I have implement it, look at the following code in [Person.razor](Client/Rira.BackEnd.SeniorTask.BlazorWebAssembly/Pages/Person.razor) :
         ```
             <CustomValidation @ref="customValidation" />
             <ValidationSummary />
             
             ....
             
          catch (Grpc.Core.RpcException ex)
          {
            errors.Add(Guid.NewGuid().ToString(), new() { ex.Status.Detail });
            ShowError();
          }
             
         ```
         
      2. Unhandled server side error. We should only show an error message such as `And error occured` and a `reference id` that user can 
         use it to call support center for furthur error tracking

2. Server side error : 
   1. Logic validation errors such as `Name is required`. That we should write test scenario for them and ensure that they work correctly.
   2.  Unhandled error : We should use `structured logging` by tools such as `Elasticsearch, Kibana` or `OpenTelemetry logging`.
      I actually do not use them deeply in my previous work, but i used `Elasticsearch, Kibana` for evalution.
